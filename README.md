# 🐍 Snake Game – Python (OOP)

A classic **Snake Game** built using **Python** and the **Turtle graphics module**, developed as part of **Day 21 of Angela Yu’s Python Bootcamp**.  
This project focuses on applying **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to build clean, modular, and maintainable code.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Snake Game allows the player to control a snake using keyboard inputs.  
The snake grows longer when it eats food, and the game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself.

This project emphasizes:
- Proper class design
- Code modularity
- Game logic implementation
- Real-time movement and collision detection

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Class Inheritance
- Python Modules & File Structure
- Turtle Graphics
- Event Listeners (Keyboard Controls)
- Collision Detection
- Game Loops

If you want, I can:
- Rewrite this README to sound **more advanced**
- Add **screenshots section**
- Add **license (MIT)**
- Convert it into **resume bullet points**

Just say it, Coco 😏🔥
